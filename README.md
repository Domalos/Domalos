- 👋 Hi, I’m @Domalos
- 👀 I’m interested in an API for Meta's Threads and a working Twitter feed for websites!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and JQuery (realise latter a bit legacy)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that achieves the above :) 
- 📫 How to reach me ... on here via DM, if that exists, I guess?
